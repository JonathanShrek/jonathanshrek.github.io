I"¶<h2 id="be-a-maker">Be A Maker</h2>

<p>This is my first blog post. I am a little nervous about starting this project because I have never been the one to openly express my thoughts and opinions on the internet. I have always been very hesitant to post anything online due to criticism and self doubt. I recently found an article on Y Combinator titled ‚ÄúWhy you should write‚Äù by Preetam Nath and I was inspired to try my hand at writing as a way to better express myself and create something meaningful. I want to try and make a habit of writing my thoughts out like this and have set a reminder for myself every Thursday to write something down.</p>

<p>Be a maker. Until about a year ago this really didn‚Äôt mean a whole lot to me. I didn‚Äôt grasp the concept of creating. The world is run by those that create. Every day people are consuming things whether that be media, food, energy, etc. Without the people that create or make, we would not have these things to consume. When I began my career as a software developer I had to start turning ideas into reality on a daily basis. This is when it dawned on me how important being a maker really is.</p>

<p>What makes you unique from everyone else? How can you make a difference in the world? These are questions that can be answered by creating or making things. This can range from writing, art, music, software, metal fabrication, anything. The world is a vast ocean and you and I are nothing more than a small rain drop and so it may feel overwhelming or impossible to even make a splash. When you create something a section of that ocean relates to it and an even smaller section understands it and an even smaller section stands by it and supports it. Its in these small subsections where your impact will have the greatest impact, but if you never create or make this impact will never happen.</p>

<p>This blog post is a form of making. I am creating content that you are currently consuming. The point of this blog post might even resonate with you and encourage you to take up some sort of making hobby. If I am able to make that kind of an impact on you with my writing then I have made a splash.</p>

<p>Do not let self doubt keep you away from creating something. Any type of work that is available publicly will not resonate with some. You may receive harsh comments or feedback and that comes with the territory, but that crowd that does resonate with your work and that you did make an impact on may send you good comments and positive feedback. You can either express and share your thoughts and knowledge with others or let self doubt keep you silent and never share these wonderful thoughts and ideas that make you who you are.</p>

<p>‚ÄúEverything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. - Steve Jobs‚Äù</p>

<p>The world belongs to the makers.</p>

<p>A single photo can get millions of views online. A single book can sell millions of copies. A single business can sell millions of products. The world belongs to those that were not afraid to fail and embraced the knowledge that they could make a splash even if only in a small subsection of the people in this world.</p>

<p>Stop procrastinating and begin making it a habit to create something. Set a reminder and stick to it.</p>

<p>‚ÄúToo many people die with their best ideas still inside of them. - James Clear‚Äù</p>

<p>A legacy is built upon things that you have shared throughout your life.</p>

<p>Instead of watching someone else play the game, its time to step into the arena and play the game ourselves.</p>

<p>‚ÄúYou can either be judged because you created something or ignored because you left your greatness inside of you. Your call. - James Clear‚Äù</p>
