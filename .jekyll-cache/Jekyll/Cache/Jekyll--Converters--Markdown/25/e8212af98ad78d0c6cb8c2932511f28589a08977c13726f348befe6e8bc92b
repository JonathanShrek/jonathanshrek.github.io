I"™<p>This is my first blog post. I am a little nervous about starting this project because I have never been one to openly express my thoughts and opinions on the internet. I have always been very hesitant to share anything online due to criticism and self doubt. I recently found an article on Y Combinator titled ‚ÄúWhy you should write‚Äù by Preetam Nath and I was inspired to try my hand at writing as a way to better express myself and create something meaningful. I want to try and make a habit of writing out my thoughts and have set a reminder to write every Thursday.</p>

<p>Be a maker. Until about a year ago this really didn‚Äôt mean a whole lot to me. I didn‚Äôt grasp the importance of creating. The world is run by those that create. Every day people are consuming things whether that be media, food, energy, etc. Without the people that create or make, we would not have anything to consume. When I began my career as a software developer I had to start turning ideas into reality on a daily basis. This is when it dawned on me how important being a maker really is.</p>

<p>What makes you unique from everyone else? How can you make a difference in the world? These are questions that can be answered by creating or making things. Making can range from writing, art, music, software, metal fabrication, anything.</p>

<p>Pretend for a minute that all of society is an ocean and you and I are nothing more than a small rain drop. It may feel overwhelming or impossible to make a splash with your work. When you create something a section of society relates to it, an even smaller section understands it, and an even smaller section stands by it and supports it. Its in these small subsections where your work can have the greatest impact, but if you never create then this impact will never happen.</p>

<p>This blog post is a form of making. I am creating content that you are currently consuming. The point of this blog post might even resonate with you and encourage you to take up some sort of creative hobby. If I am able to make that kind of an impression on you with my writing, then I have made an impact.</p>

<p>Do not let self doubt keep you from creating or sharing something. Any type of work that is available publicly will not resonate with some. You may receive harsh comments or feedback and that is okay. The crowd that <em>does</em> resonate with your work may give you good comments and positive feedback. This crowd may also stand up for you against those leaving you harsh feedback.</p>

<p>You can either express your thoughts and knowledge with others or let self doubt keep you silent and never share these wonderful thoughts and ideas that make you who you are.</p>

<p>A single photo can get millions of views online. A single book can sell millions of copies. A single business can sell millions of products. The world belongs to those that are not afraid to fail and embraced the knowledge that they could make an impact even if only in a small subsection of the people in this world.</p>

<p>Stop procrastinating and begin making it a habit to create something. Set a reminder and stick to it.</p>

<p>A legacy is built upon things that you have shared throughout your life.</p>

<p>Instead of watching someone else play the game, its time to step into the arena and play the game ourselves.</p>
