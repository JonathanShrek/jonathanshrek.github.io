I"Š<p>This past week was rough for me personally. My latest application at work had a rougher release than what I had hoped for. My manager pointed out that I was beating myself up for even the smallest of tickets and he was right. It took me stepping back to realize that the issues I was dwelling on were mostly trivial and pretty standard for a new major software release. Even though I realized this, for some strange reason I was still being hard on myself. It then dawned on me that I was dwelling on these issues and making them out to be bigger issues than what they were.</p>
