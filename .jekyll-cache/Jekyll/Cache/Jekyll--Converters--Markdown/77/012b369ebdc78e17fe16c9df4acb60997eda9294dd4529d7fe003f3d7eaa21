<p>I utilized my own HTML templates, but had no prior knowledge of liquid nor the required Jekyll system file format. I took <a href="http://twitter.com/mmistakes">Michael Rose</a>â€™s theme <a href="http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/">Minimal Mistakes</a>. Having a prebuilt archive and the YAML front-matter already set up was a great help.</p>
