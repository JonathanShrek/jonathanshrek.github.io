I"Å<p>This past week was rough for me. My latest application at work had a rougher release than what I had hoped for. My manager pointed out that I was beating myself up for even the smallest of tickets and he was right. It took me stepping back to realize that the issues I was dwelling on were mostly trivial and pretty standard for a new major software release. Even though I realized this, for some strange reason I was still being hard on myself. It then dawned on me that I was dwelling on these issues and making them out to be bigger issues than what they were.</p>

<p>I now realize that I have a dwelling problem. I replay scenarios in my head over and over and twist and contort small issues into bigger problems. This leads to me being harder on myself for even the smallest of tasks and reduces my self confidence.</p>
