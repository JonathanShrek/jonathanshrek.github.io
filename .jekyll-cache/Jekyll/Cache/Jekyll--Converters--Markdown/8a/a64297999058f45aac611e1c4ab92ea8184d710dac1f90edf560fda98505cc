<p>If you are reading this right now I want you to realize you are rich beyond your wildest dreams. Let me clarify. In this life you are given a finite amount of time. The value of your time is determined by you and you alone. If you value your time then you are more likely to make the most of it meaning your earning potential is as high as you can dream.</p>

<p>College is a goal for a lot of young people and can be a great investment into yourself and your future career, but if you are not careful you could end up in debt for a very long time. I have personally seen young adults pressured into going to big, expensive schools by their parents, other adults, and even their friends. If your parents saved up a college fund for you as you were growing up then this might be an option, but if not you should be very careful about not falling into this trap.</p>

<p>Trying to go to college without a college fund can be a difficult challenge, but it is still possible to get a college degree with little to no debt. Look into getting your basics at a local community college. Not only is this a cheaper way to get some college credits, but it also allows you to feel out exactly what you want to major in without going into extreme debt. It is important to note what type of accreditation the community college you are going to has though. Regional accreditation is the most widely-recognized type of accreditation and any credits that you earn with a regionally accredited school are most likely going to transfer to a bigger university. When looking for a community college always check to see what kind of accreditation they have.</p>

<p>Student loans do have their place and in the right circumstances can help, but its important to remember that student loans are not forgiven by bankruptcy and can follow you forever. Be very careful about taking out student loans. Also, do not think just because you have a degree you are guaranteed a job and the average salary for your chosen profession is not always what you will be making when you first enter the field.</p>

<p>If you are young, its important to realize that investing into your retirement is more important now than ever. Leveraging the amount of time you are in the market will pay exponentially more in the long run than investing more later in life.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0212/5-advantages-to-investing-in-your-20s.aspx">Investopedia</a>, ‚ÄúA single $10,000 investment at age 20 would grow to over $70,000 by the time the investor was 60 years old (based on a 5% interest rate). That same $10,000 investment made at age 30 would yield about $43,000 by age 60, and made at age 40 would yield only $26,000. The longer money is put to work, the more wealth it can generate in the future.‚Äù</p>

<p>With the current mortgage rates, 3.03% for a 30 year fixed loan according to bankrate.com, some people say that its more important to invest in the market than paying off your home early because the return is potentially greater than the amount of interest paid over the life of the mortgage. If you are looking to buy a home during this period of low interest rates its also important to note that these low interest rates are reflected onto the housing market in most places and the cost of homes has risen. The inverse of this is when interest rates begin to rise again home prices will start to lower in most places. Do not overbuy on a home. Do your research and look at what the house sold for previously, also look at comparables.</p>

<p>Its also very important to understand that the market will go up and down, but in the entire history of the S&amp;P500 it has only gone up. If you are investing and the market takes a downturn it is critical that you do not panic sell your investments. A downturn in the market is an opportunity to buy stocks at a cheaper price than you were before. This is a process called dollar-cost averaging.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dollarcostaveraging.asp">Investopedia</a> defines dollar-cost averaging as a tool an investor can use to build savings and wealth over a long period. It is also a way for an investor to neutralize short-term volatility in the broader equity market. A perfect example of dollar cost averaging is its use in 401(k) plans, in which regular purchases are made regardless of the price of any given equity within the account.‚Äù</p>

<p>If you qualify, you should also look into a Roth IRA account. This is another investment account, but is post tax, meaning it is money that you have already paid taxes on. A Roth IRA is great because you have already paid the tax on the money so any returns on that money invested is tax free. Once you reach age 59.5 and your IRA account has been opened for 5 or more years, you can withdraw any amount at anytime without incurring a tax liability.</p>

<p>As a young person its also important to build credit. Growing up I was told by everyone to avoid credit and I know others that were also told this. If you are not financially disciplined then this statement is accurate and you should stay away from credit cards. A credit card is like a financial chainsaw. It can be very dangerous if misused, but also very useful if utilized correctly. One of the greatest decisions I made in my early twenties was to open a no annual fee credit card. I used this card only for gas to get me back and forth from school and I made sure to pay it off as soon as a transaction posted to it. If I didn‚Äôt have the money in the bank then I did not charge it. This routine helped me to develop good habits and that line of credit was aging and helping my credit.</p>

<p>After you are able to demonstrate that you understand the basics of credit and you are financially disciplined, then its time to learn about leveraging credit card rewards for profit. Multiple credit cards are not a bad thing if you are responsible and actually helps to thicken your credit file and makes your score more resilient to inquiries and new lines of credit. For starters I would recommend the Chase trifecta as a way of leveraging credit card rewards for travel.</p>

<p>Its critical to ensure that you have savings to fall back on in case of an emergency, also called a nest egg. A nest egg allows you to sleep comfortably at night knowing that you can handle whatever tomorrow throws at you. The amount of your nest egg depends on a variety of factors, but most agree between 6-12 months of expenses. If you have kids they say to add 3 months to your existing nest egg.</p>

<p>By leveraging the time that you have while you are young, you can maximize the income potential of your future. Try to avoid falling into unnecessary time sinks that do not add value to your life. If you make good financial decisions while you are young you will be setting yourself up for success in the future.</p>
