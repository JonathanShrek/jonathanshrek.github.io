<p>This past week was rough for me. My latest application at work had a rougher release than what I had hoped for. My manager pointed out that I was beating myself up for even the smallest of tickets and he was right. It took me stepping back to realize that the issues I was dwelling on were mostly trivial and pretty standard for a new major software release. Even though I realized this, for some strange reason I was still being hard on myself. It then dawned on me that I was dwelling on these issues and making them out to be bigger issues than what they were.</p>

<p>I now realize that I have a dwelling problem. I replay scenarios in my head over and over and twist and contort small issues into bigger problems. This leads to me being harder on myself for even the smallest of mistakes and reduces my self confidence.</p>

<p>After some introspection, I now realize I have been like this for as long as I can remember. After my switch to software development I feel like it has amplified in some ways though. Software development demands a certain amount of perfection. The smallest typo can keep a program from compiling. The smallest flaw in design can lead to data not being captured correctly. These small, but critical details are what actually drew me into this field.</p>

<h2 id="i-love-a-good-challenge">I love a good challenge</h2>

<p>There is something about the grind of trying to accomplish something challenging that I just love. In high school it was running long distances fast and constantly trying to beat the stopwatch. If someone tells me that I canâ€™t do something, it only makes me want to prove them wrong.</p>

<p>I did not grow up writing code. It wasnâ€™t until after my second college degree that I decided I wanted to try my hand at writing code. Once I started, there was no turning back and I immediately enrolled into the Computer Science program at one of the nearby universities.</p>

<p>This drive to conquer challenges stretches into all facets of my life. From finances, health, relationships, education, etc. I want to make the most out of my time on this planet and so I strive for perfection.</p>

<h2 id="perfectionism-is-imperfect">Perfectionism is imperfect</h2>

<p>The constant strive for perfection can lead to many good things in life such as being healthy, financially disciplined, well educated, etc., but it also leads to many problems. Striving for perfection leaves you with that feeling of never feeling good enough. That feeling alone has a big impact on your overall quality of life.</p>

<p><strong>YOU ARE ENOUGH</strong>.</p>

<p>Nobody will ever be you and that alone makes you perfect.</p>
